## Benjamin Burton

Welcome to my website at benburton.org!

At the moment this is just a handful of links to real websites.

- [My university website](http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~bab):
  I am a half-mathematician, half-computer scientist at The University of Queensland.

- [My iPhone/iPad/Watch apps](https://sites.google.com/site/appsformaths/):
  I write apps in my spare time; all of these are apps that I use myself.
  They include:

  - [Modular Arithmetic](https://sites.google.com/site/appsformaths/modular-arithmetic/),
    to do arithmetic modulo _N_;
  - [PDF Projector](https://sites.google.com/site/appsformaths/pdf-projector/),
    to project your PDF slideshows onto an external screen;
  - [References](https://sites.google.com/site/appsformaths/references/),
    to browse through your BibTeX databases;
  - [Talk Timer](https://sites.google.com/site/appsformaths/talk-timer/),
    to discreetly track time while you give a talk.

- [Regina](https://regina-normal.github.io/):
  A large body of software for computational topology that I have been working on for over 20 years now.
  How time flies!
