Welcome to my website at _benburton.org_!

At the moment this is just a handful of links to real websites.

- **Mathematics**:
  I am a half-mathematician, half-computer scientist at The University of Queensland (UQ),
  in Brisbane, Australia. For more on my mathematics, see:
  
  - [My university website](http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~bab) at UQ;
  - [Regina](https://regina-normal.github.io/), a large body of software for
    computational topology that I have been working on for over 20 years now.
  
- **Outreach programmes**:
  I spend a lot of time with outreach programmes for talented secondary school students
  in mathematics and computer science. These include:
  
  - [The International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)](http://www.ioinformatics.org/),
    which is the premier competition for programing and algorithm design for secondary school students.
    I spent 10 years as a leader of the Australian delegation,
    and I am currently an elected member of the International Committee that oversees the IOI.
    We also hosted [IOI 2013 in Brisbane, Australia](http://www.ioi2013.org/)!
  - [The National Mathematics Summer School (NMSS)](https://nmss.edu.au/), which gives
    talented and enthusiastic secondary students a taste of research, and what _doing_ mathematics
    is really like. I have been involved as a tutor and lecturer for over two decades,
    and currently serve as Director of NMSS.

- [**My iPhone/iPad/Watch apps**](https://sites.google.com/site/appsformaths/):
  I write apps in my spare time; all of these are apps that I use myself.
  They include:

  - [Modular Arithmetic](https://sites.google.com/site/appsformaths/modular-arithmetic/),
    to do arithmetic modulo _N_;
  - [PDF Projector](https://sites.google.com/site/appsformaths/pdf-projector/),
    to project your PDF slideshows onto an external screen;
  - [References](https://sites.google.com/site/appsformaths/references/),
    to browse through your BibTeX databases;
  - [Talk Timer](https://sites.google.com/site/appsformaths/talk-timer/),
    to discreetly track time while you give a talk;
  - [Inkpad Libre](https://github.com/baburton/inkpad/),
    which is the open-source continuation of Steve Sprang's excellent vector graphics app for the iPad.
