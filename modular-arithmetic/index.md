## Modular Arithmetic  <img src="modarith-120.png" width=120 height=120 align="right" alt="Modular Arithmetic App Icon">

A calculator for arithmetic modulo _N_.  It lets you choose a fixed modulus,
and then make lots of calculations without having to press a "mod" button again
and again.  It also:

- supports fast modular division and exponentiation;
- follows the order convention;
- supports arbitrarily large numbers;
- can show a full transcript of your calculation.

**Who wrote this?**

Benjamin Burton.  By day I do research in computational geometry and topology
at The University of Queensland
(see [my university site](http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~bab)),
and a lot of my work involves writing mathematical software.
I do iOS programming in my spare time.

**Why this app?**

It was something I wanted myself - to fix a modulus and then make lots of
quick calculations.  It is useful, for instance, in classical cryptography
where you work consistently modulo 26 (if you are using the English alphabet).

**Was it written carefully?**

Yes - I very much care about correct results!  The code is backed up by a
thorough suite of automated mathematical tests.
