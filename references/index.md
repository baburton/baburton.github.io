Carry your BibTeX libraries with you on your iPad and iPhone!

A _BibTeX library_ is a collection of bibliographic references (papers, books,
reports, etc.), designed to work with the LaTeX typesetting system. Each
library is stored in a specially-formatted text file (typically ending in
.bib), which you can create with your favourite text editor.

The _References_ app gives you an easy way to browse through and interact with
your BibTeX libraries. You can scroll, search, follow links, and view file
attachments. In particular:

- The app creates links from DOIs, MathSciNet references, ACM IDs, and of
  course URLs.

- The app understands elementary LaTeX, so if your titles and/or abstracts
  contain markup or mathematics (and if your LaTeX is simple enough) then the
  app can display them nicely.

- If you used BibDesk or JabRef to create your library, the app can view your
  file attachments (e.g., PDFs that you have attached to your references).

**Who wrote this?**

Benjamin Burton.  By day I do research in computational geometry and topology
at The University of Queensland (see
[my university site](http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~bab/)),
and a lot of my work involves writing mathematical software.  I do iOS
programming in my spare time.

**Why this app?**

This was something I wanted - I use BibTeX for my own papers, and I like being
able to browse through my BibTeX libraries and PDF attachments on my iPad.

**Was it written carefully?**

Yes - the BibTeX parser and elementary LaTeX interpreter have both been
hand-written with great care and extensive testing. If you have BibTeX files
that are not parsed correctly or LaTeX that is not being displayed as nicely
as it could be, I would be very happy for you to mail me at the address above
with the details.

**Privacy Policy**

In short: References does the right thing by you as far as possible. It only
accesses the files and folders that you have asked it to, and you can easily
revoke this access at any time. It does not send any information to the
developer or other third parties, except for activities that are beyond its
control.

In detail: [read the full privacy policy here](privacy.md).

Enjoy!
